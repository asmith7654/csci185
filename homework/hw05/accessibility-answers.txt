1. What corrections did you have to make?

I had to add alt text to the images, add a language attribute, and add labels to the different form controls.

1. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

I don't think it would be usable for someone who needs accessibility accomodations. I would imagine you could still use it otherwise though. 

1. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

It is!



Reminder: don't forget to include a screenshot of your Wave report and link to it from your homepage!

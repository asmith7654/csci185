			<h2>What is u-Substitution?</h2>
			<section class="innersection1">
			<p class="what">U-Substitution, also known as the "reverse chain rule," is a technique used in calculus to simplify integrals. It involves substituting a complex expression with a simpler one by using a new variable u.</p>
			<p class="what">The basic idea is to identify a part of the integrand whose derivative is involved in the equation in some way already. We then substitute that expression for u, and rewrite the entire integral in terms of u.</p>

			<h2>How to use u-Substitution</h2>
			<ol class="innersection2">
				<li>Identify a part of the integrand to substitute. It should be something whose derivative is already involved in the equation in some way.
					<p>Side note: As a rule of thumb, the inner-most part of the integrand is what should be substituted. Operations that are considered inner-most include parentheses, roots, and divisors. This is a general guideline, not a rule.</p></li>
				<li>Let u be that simpler expression. For example, lets say we are trying to integrate x/1+x^2. Let u = 1+x^2.</li>
				<li>Differentiate both sides of your u variable. For example, if your u = 1+x^2, du = 2xdx.</li>
				<li>Solve for dx and substitute your equivalent du expression in for dx in the original equation. In the example above, solving for dx we find dx = du/2. Replace your dx in the equation with du/2. </li>
				<li>Substitute in your u into the original equation.</li>
				<li>Your equation should now be integratable form. Integrate using known techniques.</li>
				<li>After you have integrated, replace your u with its original expression. This is your final answer.</li>

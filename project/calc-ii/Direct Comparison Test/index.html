			<h2>What is the Direct Comparison Test?</h2>
			<section class="innersection1">
			<p class="what">The "Direct Comparison Test" is a method used in calculus to determine the convergence or divergence of an infinite series. The test involves comparing the given series to a known series whose convergence or divergence is already known. The comparison series should have similar terms as the original series and be either smaller or larger in value. For the original series to converge, the comparison series must be larger and also converge. For the original series to diverge, the comparison series must be smaller and also diverge.</p>

            <p>A helpful way of thinking about this is to remember what converging and diverging means. Converging means a finite value. If you have a series that is larger, yet is finite, the original series must also be finite. Conversely, if you have a series that is smaller, yet infinite, the original series must also be infinite.</p>

			<h2>How to use the Direct Comparison Test</h2>
            <ol class="innersection2">
			<li>Look for series whose a<sub>n</sub> looks similar to a series with a known convergence/divergence. Direct comparison test is particularly good with series involving sin^2(x) or cos^2(x).</li>
            <li>Set up an inequality, and place your comparison series accordingly.</li>
            <li>If a conclusion can be made, evaluate.</li>

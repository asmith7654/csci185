			<h2>What is a Geometric Series?</h2>
			<section class="innersection1">
			<p class="what">A geometric series is a type of series in which each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant called the common ratio. The general form of a geometric series is:

                a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ...
                
                where 'a' is the first term of the series, 'r' is the common ratio, and the ellipsis (...) indicates that the series continues infinitely.</p>
			<p>An example of a geometric series is the infinite division of squares mentioned in the Introduction to Series page. That series can be represented by Σ(1/2)^n.</p>

			<h2>Identifying Geometric Series and Their Parts</h2>
			<section class="innersection2">
			<p>It is important to be able to identify a geometric series and its parts. A couple of ways you may see geometric series presented include an expanded summation of terms multiplied by the same ratio, a fraction as a whole raised to a certain exponent, or the denominator of a fraction raised to an exponent while the numerator is one. Here are some examples of what those look like:</p>
            <p>Expanded summation of terms: 1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + 1/81 ....</p>
            <p>Whole fraction raised to a power: Σ <sub>n=0</sub> <sup>&infin;</sup>(1/3)^n</p>
            <p>Denominator raised to a power while numerator is one: Σ<sub>n=0</sub> <sup>&infin;</sup> (1/(3^n))</p>
			<p>All of these are valid ways to represent a geometric series. At first glance it may appear that examples 2 and 3 do not have an a (or first term) in the notation, but they do. The a in both examples is 1.</p>
            <p>You will commonly be asked to create a representation of a geometric series in the form Σ a(r)^n, where a is the first term, and r is the ratio. If asked to find the first term, either take the first term from the expanded summation of terms, or evaluate the sigma notation sum at the start of the index. The start of the index is whatever n is equal to on the bottom of the sigma symbol. To calculate the ratio, divide the n + 1 term by the n term in the summation expansion. </p>

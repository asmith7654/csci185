			<h2>What is the Divergence Test?</h2>
			<section class="innersection1">
			<p class="what">The divergence test, also known as the nth term test for divergence, is a method used to determine whether an infinite series converges or diverges. The test states that if the limit of the nth term of a series as n approaches infinity is not equal to zero, then the series diverges.</p>
			<p>In other words, if the limit of the a<sub>n</sub> is not equal to zero, then the series does not converge. However, it is important to note that the test only tells us that the series diverges; if the limit is equal to zero, no information is obtained.</p>

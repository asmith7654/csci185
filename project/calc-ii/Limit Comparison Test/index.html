			<h2>What is the Limit Comparison Test?</h2>
			<section class="innersection1">
			<p class="what">The limit comparison test is a method of determining the convergence or divergence of an infinite series. It involves comparing the given series to another series whose convergence or divergence is already known. To perform the limit comparison test, you must divide the original series by the series you are comparing it to, then take the limit. If the limit is equal to one, the original series has the same convergence/divergence as the comparison. If the limit is zero, than the comparison series must converge to make any conclusions. If it does, the original series converges as well. If the limit is infinity, the comparison series must diverge to make any conclusions. If it does, the original series diverges as well.</p>

			<h2>How to use the Limit Comparison Test</h2>
            <ol class="innersection2">
			<li>Look for series whose a<sub>n</sub> looks similar to a series with a known convergence/divergence. Limit comparison test is strongest when the limit is equal to one, so try to compare to a series that will produce a limit equal to one.</li>
            <li>Divide the original series by the comparison series. It is helpful to remember that dividing two fractions is the same as multiplying by the denominator's reciprocal.</li>
            <li>Take the limit. Make evaluations accordingly.</li>

			<h2>What is Trig Substitution?</h2>
			<section class="innersection1">
			<p class="what">Trig substitution is a technique used in calculus to simplify integrals that involve expressions containing square roots of quadratic expressions or sums and differences of squares. The method involves making a substitution of the form x = a sinθ, x = a tanθ, or x = a secθ, where a is a constant and θ is a variable. </p>
            <p>This substitution allows the integral to be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions, which can be more easily integrated using standard trigonometric identities. Trig substitution is particularly useful when dealing with integrals that involve the square roots of quadratic expressions. </p>

			<h2>How to use Trig Substitution</h2>
			<ol class="innersection2">
				<li>Look for algebraic expressions under a radical sign.</li>
				<li>Identify the type of substitution required based on the algebraic expression. The three possible types of substitution are:

                    <p> If the expression involves a term of the form a^2 - x^2, substitute x = a sin(theta).</p> 
                    <p> If the expression involves a term of the form a^2 + x^2, substitute x = a tan(theta).</p>
                        <p> If the expression involves a term of the form x^2 - a^2, substitute x = a sec(theta).</p>
					Do not forget to differentiate your substitution so you can replace your dx with the appropriate expression. For example, if your x = 1tan(theta), dx = 1sec^2(theta)d(theta). </li>
				<li>Substitute the expression under the radical with the appropriate trigonometric identity.</li>
				<li>Simplify the integral using trigonometric identities until it is integratable. Integrate.</li>
                <li>Solve the integral by substituting back to the original variable, x. If your original substitution was x = 1tan(theta), create a triangle by solving for tan(theta). Tan(theta) = x/1, so the opposite side of the triangle is x, the adjacent is 1, and the hypotenuse is (x^2+1)^1/2. Using these sides, you can replace trig functions involving theta back to x's. If you have a theta that is not attached to a trig function, solve for theta directly. If x/1 = tan(theta), arctan(x/1) = theta. You can now replace your theta back to the original variable.</li>

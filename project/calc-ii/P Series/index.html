			<h2>What is a P-Series?</h2>
			<section class="innersection1">
			<p class="what">In calculus, the p-series is a type of infinite series of the form:</p>

			<p>	Î£ <sub>n=1</sub> <sup>&infin;</sup>1/n^p </p>
				
			<p>	where p is a constant greater than 0. The p-series is an important example in the study of infinite series, because its convergence behavior depends on the value of p.
				If p is greater than 1, the p-series converges, which means that the sum of its terms approaches a finite value as the number of terms increases. If p is less than or equal to 1, the p-series diverges, which means that the sum of its terms does not approach a finite value as the number of terms increases.</p>

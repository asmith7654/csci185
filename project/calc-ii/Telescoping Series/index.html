			<h2>What is a Telescoping Series?</h2>
			<section class="innersection1">
			<p class="what">A telescoping series is a series where many of the terms cancel out, leaving only a finite number of terms to be added. In other words, a telescoping series is a series where the partial sums simplify to a finite expression.</p>
			<p>An example of a telescoping series would be Σ <sub>n=1</sub> <sup>&infin;</sup> [1/n+1 - 1/n+2]. If you expand the terms out, it looks like: 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/4 - 1/5 ... 1/n-1 - 1/n + 1/n - 1/n+1 + 1/n+1 - 1/n+2. As you can see, all of terms cancel out except for 1/2 and -1/n+2. The partial sum would be 1/2 - 1/n+2.</p>
			<p>You can then find the summation of the series by taking the limit of the nth partial sum as n approaches infinity. The limit above would become: 1/2 - 1/∞+2. 1/∞+2 will grow closer and closer to zero as n approaches infinity, so the sum of the series is 1/2. </p>

			<h2>How to find the sum of a telescoping series</h2>
			<ol class="innersection2">
				<li>Look for something in the form of Σ [a/b - a/c]. Sometimes you will find a fraction that you can use partial fraction decomposition on, and after it has been decomposed it will follow the form mentioned at the beginning.</li>
				<li>Expand the terms and look for terms that cancel.</li>
				<li>Reduce to leftover terms. You now have the nth partial sum.</li>
				<li>Take the limit as n approaches infinity of the nth partial sum.</li>
				<li>If the answer is a finite value, the sum of the series converges to said finite value. If the answer is some form of infinity or something oscillating, the series diverges.</li>

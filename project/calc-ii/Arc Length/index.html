			<h2>What is an Improper Integral?</h2>
			<section class="innersection1">
			<p class="what">An improper integral is an integral that does not have a finite value because either the interval of integration is infinite or the integrand function has a vertical asymptote or a discontinuity within the interval of integration. In other words, it is an integral that either involves an infinite limit or an integrand function that is not defined or does not behave properly over the entire interval of integration. This page will focus on infinite limits specifically.</p>
			<p>To evaluate an improper integral, it is necessary to take the limit of the integral as the interval of integration approaches infinity. If the limit exists, then the improper integral is said to converge, and if the limit does not exist (infinite, oscillates, etc.), then the improper integral is said to diverge.</p>

			<h2>How to evaluate Improper Integrals</h2>
			<ol class="innersection2">
				<li>Rewrite the integral in proper form. If the bounds involve infinity, take the limit of the integral as it approaches infinity. Replace the infinity symbol in the integral with a variable.</li>
				<li>Integrate the now proper integral.</li>
				<li>Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and take the limit as your variable approaches infinity.</li> 
				<li>If the answer is finite and does not oscillate between values (ie. sinx/cosx function), then the integral is said to converge. If the integral is infinite or oscillates between values, it is said to diverge. </li>
